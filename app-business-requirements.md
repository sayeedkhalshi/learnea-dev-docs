<h2>This is how the profuct can be developed to the technical perspective. Concept of layers, nodes, motion, momentum, changes, wave, frequency and other universe's virtual and quantum properties will be enforced by imlementing those features below. So learning becomes natural. But they also follow other learning related terms. The economics portion isn't ready yet. </h2>
 <h4>Base features</h4>
 <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>Users - wallet</li>
    <li>Threads - from the 'single state of action mind' hypothesis - only one thread is allowed for learning threads. ('Threads' instead of PTSD and force learning attatched word 'goal')</li>
    <li>The thread will run a main flow</li>
    <li>Flow has intention or (goal)</li>
    <li>Intentions are attached to activity. So far this will make people run in a flow. Now we can introduce projects under that activity. So that activity will become a goal. Goal will have project and project will have activity. Breaking flow means a lot away from the goal</li>
    <li>Wave function</li>
    <li>Learning threads and process based</li>

            <li>Sub terms - terms that makes up a term</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Learning Philosophy of term (acts like a term)- what you learned from a term. Philosophies are Gem terms. Some philosphies are called genuine gem. When a genuine gem is made, people will run to explain how to explain it in terms of control structure to simulate reality. Many new things can be created. Their actions will be rewarded more. </li>
    <>
    <li>intersections of terms</li>
    <li>Frequency - repeat, repeat, repeat in weeks, months, years - repeats are rewarded most. Repeating means doubling your input</li>
    <li>Public voting</li>
    <li>Given an AI companion as they can learn and teach for each person differently. A grand AI knows all will be personalized for each person</li>
    <li>Mainstrem terms are voted ranking in realtime. Only spcieal learing terms are there. They are usually the topics from my book</li>
    <li>Promotions</li>
    <li>Flows - how many flows you are running. What is the current flow, what flow this thread belowngs to</li>
    <li>Thread - how many thread of learnig is going on. What is the main one, what are the sub threads. Each unfinished activity is a explicit thread.</li>
    <li>Frequency Meter to show frequency and user coming to a topics. Based on coming back in terms if days and how much time each day, we measure frequency and wave for topics, activity, or each thing that where the user spends most time in</li>
</ul>
 <h4>Explaining Base features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        Terms - creating terms. Terms are learning or learning curves, learned philosophy
    </li>
    <li>Change of everything because of interactions. How much changed is shown by percentage with history(version). Which history changed how much.</li>
    <li>Terms will have - Term Name, Terms Perspective, Terms Source Terms[], Terms Projecting/pointing to terms, more projections/perspectives close to it, Details
    </li>
    <li>Details will have - A micro learning path/plain text
        <ul>
            <li>Each path will have todo to more terms or paths</li>
            <li>Each path will have a lot of learning curve(curves are amusing pain points)</li>
            <li>Each time a user goes far away from the main path. It shows the percentage of how far he is, how much is done, what are the closest paths to it, what are the closest terms to it, what are the closest learning curves to it</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Goals will be set by a user</li>
    <li>Each goal will have activity</li>
    <li>People with similar goals can look at others activity of how they did it.</li>
    <li>While writing activity, people are adding philosophy, terms, paths, curves too, so they connects with that term directly and shows how this term amused the doer to have this term</li>
    <li>Activities will have one path choose by the user or paths are created by project creator, or paths are created by community</li>
    <li>Activites are customly created by picking a term, a path, a curve, a perspective etc and they can create a path for others to use</li>
    <li>Paths are also created by users directly</li>
    <li>Each path will have micro paths in it</li>
    <li>The goal is to learn a topic for a project</li>
    <li>Each micro path will attach micro acitivites like layers</li>
    <li>Perspectives, Projections will wrap the terms, paths, curves, activities, and other perspectives together. So a there can be many paths to learn a topic. Those paths are made when a user customly creates them to make a path while doing activity. Path can be perspective base and person base as we love to admire others</li>
    <li>All works are rewarded. But most rewarding is creating layers from perspectives.</li>
    <li>After learning a topic, the user can create a philosophy, art form, project, course, animation, explanation, debate or anything from it and share. Thats Fun.</li>
    <li>Art forms can be sold, donated, gift to someone admires the creator on rare case. Cause artforms are valuable portfolio</li>
    <li>Each term will have chatroom for each perspective</li>
    <li>Each chatroom will have a chat history</li>
    <li>People can share ideas and learning in chatroom before writing a term, asking questions. No explicit questionaire</li>
    <li>Goals and activity are under projects. Projects are created by users and they can create goals and activities. Projects can be shared with other users.</li>
    <li>People joins paid or free in a project</li>
    <li>Each project will have chatrooms, tasks, boards, activity. Activity will create a path. </li>
    <li> Terms intersections are created. One topics will be described from another. Intersected Terms</li>
    <li>Promotions - anything can be promoted. Some super necessary things will be promoted for free. </li>
    <li>Promotions will take fund to the main balance of the website.</li>
    <li>Must be in a Learning Team</li>
    <li>Must follow a Learning Leader</li>
    <li>Must be under a Learning Project</li>
    <li>Every problem will be divided into Learning tasks</li>
    <li>Solving the process of every task is a Learning Activity</li>
    <li>Every Activity will be solved in Attempts - Learning Attempts</li>
    <li>Every attempt will be reviewed by other team members or leaders or other invited persons. A example is here - Activity Management, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJl_E6qh2LSk20l8F3wWQJbWFBoMCHU0bSqfL8F7z_A/edit#heading=h.e4lh9w6dlg4i</li>
    <li>Every activity and attempt must have the process attached if it has something new to learn for the learner</li>
    <li>Everyone documents their learning process</li>
    <li>Must document the step of doing a process for public</li>
    <li>Must document the project of learning something.</li>
    <li>A message board for each project filterable by user. Every 10-20 minute there should a message</li>
</ul>

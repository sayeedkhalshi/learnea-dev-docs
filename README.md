<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Document each learning - each hypothesis from each perspective. Where hypothesises don't have to be proved. Every expression is already because someone had felt it. Maybe from a distorted sense but still they faced it. We need to know what certain perspective has to say for a certain situation. </li>
    <li>Name each learning - each hypothesis. Naming or terming a perspective makes us name the feelings and we can communicate our feelings using those names</li>
    <li>Understand each perspective by understanding how they are built</li>
    <li>Describe each perspective from every other perspective</li>
    <li>Describe each terms from every other terms</li>
    <li>Every gets to share everything</li>
    <li>P2P debate and moderation to resolve conflicting expression, manipulation, lies and propagandas.</li>
    <li>Documentation of learning each topics by a learner</li>
    <li>Reviewing each others learning, reviewing reviews too</li>
    <li>Categorize learners by their learning and working ability</li>
    <li>Developing projects and gathering teams to build a project</li>
    <li>Funding oppurtunity for each projects</li>
    <li>Project and team management</li>
    <li>Earning for each task done. Each learning, review, comment, project etc</li>
</ul>

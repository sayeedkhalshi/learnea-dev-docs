<h1>everylearning.org - Learning Terms Network where each terms meet each other</h1>
<p>This learning system is being developed from my ongoing research on Learning Science. Purpose is to document each terms, each perspective, each hypothesis, each learning curve, each understanding and each learning process. 
A book is being written. </p>

<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Document each learning - each hypothesis from each perspective. Where hypothesises don't have to be proved. Every expression is already because someone had felt it. Maybe from a distorted sense but still they faced it. We need to know what certain perspective has to say for a certain situation. </li>
    <li>Name each learning - each hypothesis. Naming or terming a perspective makes us name the feelings and we can communicate our feelings using those names</li>
    <li>Understand each perspective by understanding how they are built</li>
    <li>Describe each perspective from every other perspective</li>
    <li>Describe each terms from every other terms</li>
    <li>Every gets to share everything</li>
    <li>P2P debate and moderation to resolve conflicting expression, manipulation, lies and propagandas.</li>
    <li>Documentation of learning each topics by a learner</li>
    <li>Reviewing each others learning, reviewing reviews too</li>
    <li>Categorize learners by their learning and working ability</li>
    <li>Developing projects and gathering teams to build a project</li>
    <li>Funding oppurtunity for each projects</li>
    <li>Project and team management</li>
    <li>Earning for each task done. Each learning, review, comment, project etc</li>
    <li>Award for each category. Anyone can create an award and ask for funding. Automate the system for winner</li>
    <li>Public voting</li>
    <li>Accounts for AI</li>
    <li>Share Art Forms</li>
    <li>Rewards for deserving arts, terms, with so much money that mainstream art forms become irrelavant</li>
</ul>

<h1>The Learning System -</h1>
<ul>
<li>A learning system solves the problem a learner faces. A learning system is based on some philosophy</li>
<li>
<ul>Motto
<li>Don’t just learn by doing, make learning a doing</li>
<li>Not a control structure, not by making learning a system. A no-system structure or a authenticated structure. A no structure structure or unbiased way. A place open for all uniqueness.</li>
<li>First come, first learn. Learn topics as they come with a topic.</li>
<li>Link all topics to each other</li>
<li>Link all perspective/learning from to each other</li>
<li>Explain and name/term each perspective</li>
<li>Conect the topics and create a new perspective</li>
<li>Document each learning</li>
<li>Comment, review each learning</li>
<li>Redo learning by day, week, monthly, yearly and more</li>
<li>Take learning break</li>
<li>Redo and rewire the learning</li>
<li>Reward and credit system</li>
<li>Voting for each terms to be considered as mainstream.</li>
<li>Go mainstream means that term is common for most people.</li>
<li>Writing and typing both ability on the website (PTSD paradox of writing and typing)</li>
<li>Perspective doesn’t have to be proved and doesn’t need go mainstream. Each perspective is true as at least one person felt it.</li>
<li>Project Based Learning. Each learning has a purpose to build a project</li>
<li>Project gets funded</li>
<li>Learner’s get funded</li>
<li>Topics gets funded</li>
<li>Topic can be started from any perspective</li>
<li>Each topic is a roadmap to do better</li>
<li>Learning can be started from any topics to the points as needed</li>
<li>Intentions will determine which topics to learn next</li>
<li>Only a single topics can be main and all others are sub topic</li>
<li>Individual can design the course of a topics</li>
<li>Topics gets funded</li>
<li>Terms can be created</li>
<li> Terms intersections are created. One topics will be described from another. Intersected Terms</li>
<li>Promotions - anything can be promoted. Some super necessary things will be promoted for free. </li>
<li>Promotions will take fund to the main balance of the website.</li>
<li>Founder can’t take more than 1B in total. Co-founders can take upto 100m. Every investor can’t take more than 10% at a time. After 5-10 times the investors won’t be able to claim their profit. </li>
<li>The platform stays standalone without any ownership</li>
<li>ToDo based learning</li>
<li>Project based learning</li>
<li>AI based management. Real life monitoring for learning isn’t important, communicating about learning is important.</li>
<li>Learning roadmap - can be created from any topics to any topics</li>
<li>A Learning Path must follow a roadmap</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Everything is learning</li>
<li>Every learning is a problem or Everything is a problem</li>
<li>Anyone with any knowledge or no knowledge can work on any project</li>
<li>Everything is Work that creates value</li>
<li>Learn By Doing - Learning that doesn’t convert as work is not valuable and thus unreasonable to spend time on.</li>
<li>Don’t be in a Learning Hell - is that you keep learning unnecessarily a lot of things that aren’t necessary to complete the required Learning Activity and Learning Attempts where a Learning Project needs to finished to be valuable. You must avoid learning hell. Usually, you learn more on doing a project instead of just learning without a project. </li>
<li>Must be in a Learning Team</li>
<li>Must follow a Learning Leader</li>
<li>Must be under a Learning Project</li>
<li>Every problem will be divided into Learning tasks</li>
<li>Solving the process of every task is a Learning Activity</li>
<li>Every Activity will be solved in Attempts - Learning Attempts</li>
<li>Every attempt will be reviewed by other team members or leaders or other invited persons. A example is here - Activity Management, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HJl_E6qh2LSk20l8F3wWQJbWFBoMCHU0bSqfL8F7z_A/edit#heading=h.e4lh9w6dlg4i</li>
<li>Every activity and attempt must have the process attached if it has something new to learn for the learner</li>
<li>Everyone documents their learning process</li>
<li>Must document the step of doing a process for public</li>
<li>Must document the project of learning something.</li>
<li>A message board for each project filterable by user. Every 10-20 minute there should a message</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feud -</h2> 
<ul>
<li>Feud over opinion - a video about that opinion describing with terms</li>
<li>The topics is selected by the system - one by one. Maybe 7 in a week. The most hot topic selected by algorithms. Video is made by any user. </li>
<li>Feud - describing topics is like engineering whereas intelligence is like theory. Theory doesn’t take you much far but engineering takes it to the infinite creativity</li>
<li>Feud will move forward until it’s complete or solved based on logic from booth side</li>
<li>There will be an AI , Feud AI. Made by anyone. Any AI that detects Feud better will be judging the feud.<.li>
<li>Will be judged by people</li>
<li>A moderator will take  terms from each video and comments and make a video explaining what opinions is better from whose video</li>
<p>stories or artforms are developed from the terms and feuds.</p>
<li>Every feud will have every question that can be asked and should be answered correctly by the moderator and other people. Moderator must update the answer based on other peoples answer if they write better. Questions will only be under feud. </li>
<li>Terms AI. This AI will know and understand any terms and will know if any writer violates any term or follows any term</li>
<li>ReDo - Redo and revalidate previous learning by day, week, month, 6 month year and after a learning break revisit and redo all previous learning to look at from different perspective. This feature will give the system a better way to credit and score for people</li>
<li>Voting for every decision</li>
<li>Learning Path or Roadmap - A roadmap to learn from a list</li>
<li>Activities are a roadmap to learn from a list of ToDo’s. Each ToDo is a activity (ex - in link attached)</li>
<li>Steps for Pre ToDo – decision making of what to learn → Research to make decision → Options To choose from. So there is a plan file with all the plans and things you want to do in life</li>
<li>Steps for ToDo Example - Routine - software architecture → ToDo: what is architecture → Working ToDo: wikipedia page on software architecture, 38 actions and insights to become a software architecture etc → ReDo List: Everything to redo again.</li>
<li>Micro ToDo - things that has to learn to understand the Working ToDo. Also sequence of ToDo.</li>
<li>Lowest Point of Activities(link attached) or Work Note - where you exercise all your learning</li>
<li>ToDo table, desk or ToDo rake</li>

</ul>

<h2>Unique Tech Feature:-</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optional - In-Website-Terminal based use of website</li>
<li>Focused design</li>
<li>Natural Design</li>
<li>No tagging feature</li>
<li>A simple way to tag a group of users or projects or entities where the tag will directly show only the name of the logged in entity</li>
<li>Numbering checkmark</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future With Hardware or Real Life Tools! Many of them are too futuristic-</h2>
<p>To save people from burning, To preserve the skill we developed through thousand of years, To reduce the learning gap between real life and learning, we can make a learning system that can simulate real life. This can be done by making a computer simulation where a learner can simulate real world. This can be done by making a screenless computer where real objects works as computer tools. This can be done</p>
<li>Making of a computer simulation where a learner can simulate real world</li>
<li>Making of a screenless computer where real objects works as computer tools</li>
<li>Learning World like Disney World where learner can simulate reality in real to practice for real to reduce Reality Gaps</li>
<li>A learning device with in build printer</li>
<li>AI image to text for copying written todo, notes and activities. This can be done by using a camera to scan the paper and convert it to text.</li>
<li>A paper connected to the website where learner can write notes and activities instead of typing. So we can avoid double typing and mismanaging documents</li>

How a learning system works:-

<h2>Leadership:</h2>
<li>A Learning Leader has 3 quality</li>
<li>Have a vision to accomplish something</li>
<li>Have a project to finish</li>
<li>Understand the process of finishing the project</li>
<li>Manages some learners to build a team for that project</li>
<li>Understands learning terms</li>
<li>Can Udentifies learning (to prove he/she must be able to identify problems while writing reviews for Learning Activity of others)</li>
<li>Uses the Learning System to finish the project</li>
<li>Terming Topics - Knows the terms for that project. Example - Beside knowing Learning Terms, a web dev project Leader must know - Computer Science Learning Terms, Software Engineering Learning Terms and other terms for related any technology used</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learners:-</h2>
<ul>
<li>Joins a Learning Project under a Learning Leader</li>
<li>Takes Learning Activity from Learning Leader</li>
<li>Can create Learning Activity on their own</li>
<li>Finishes the project while learning</li>
<li>Learners get paid for learning</li>
<li>Can learn standalone.</li>
<li>Can get funding</li>
<li>Can get pay for learning if the topics has fund</li>
<li>Can get payment if the main vault has profit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Learning Project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Have a name</li>
<li>Have a vision</li>
<li>Have a leader</li>
<li>Have a team</li>
<li>Have some founders</li>
<li>Have a process till finish</li>
<li>Have a progress meter</li>
<li>List all learning resources</li>
<li>Documents all the learning</li>
<li>Messaing all the learning and problems to message board</li>
</ul>

<p>
Fued rule -Opinion is atomic and building block of fued 1. You u listen to the arguments, 2. You understand what other say, 3. others has to agree that you understood their opinion, 4, you get time to think and prepare, 5. You share your opinion with acknowledgement and unacknowledgement 6, other has to agree that they understood, they share a list of acknowledge ment and unacknowledgement 7. Mark acknowledgement as resolved, 8 feud continues

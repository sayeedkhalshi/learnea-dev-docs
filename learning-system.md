<p>
End of the day, you sit on a corner and think about your days. Sometimes you think about life and everything. You think what you did was right and what you did wrong. How you are evolving in the world, relationships and personality etc. All those thinking you had to do because there were curves you needed to be aware of. Needed to think of them carefully and figure out how they connect. So your next step in life is better. A hope driven life moves on with new philosophies. All those things are your learnings and you keep forgetting them after a certain age. Because there are too much things to learn and things to connect. You can't keep up with all of them now. So you need to write them up.
<br />

But you can't just write them up. Because they are not just one story. They are like lots of stories. All you want to connect lessons from those stories to understand life. So, I figure, why don't just build a app that connects all the stories from everyone on earth. Is that even possible?

<br/>

Did you already figure out, writigng and talking helps understand the ideas better. More than talking with someone, having attachment with someone to depend, to share is much more than that. I was thinking more engagements on your learnings are actually a solution to allyour problems. So I spent last decade and all my earning to research and figure out this.

<br/>

Slowly you will see, you are getting wiser. Those learnings are usually personal philosophy that we know. But there is something crazy about this! It's similar for all of us. Yes that's a crazy part. Cause I thought we are all different. Literally, our brain works similar way. Then another is, you can't think of a lot. Our brain is week and has limit. That limit isn't that big also. I know these informations hurt our pride as human species.

<br />

But crazier than this, I didn't just found out what is learning and how we learn, also found a way to simplify our learning, I have found a way. -- To name them --. To name them as terms like scientific and philosophical terms. I mean all our learnings. Then on top of all, I built a learning system. A hypothesis, but going to be a reall app now.

<br />

Here you can analyze those terms. Connect those terms to other terms. Explain those terms from different perspective, people, fields and research. Other can learn from your terms, you can learn from their.

<br />

I want to have a place where there is no boundary or shame. No dumb questions or situations.

<br />

But there is also some obvious truth about learning that we don't acknowledge. Like, we are learning machine but we aren't here to learn but to breed, work and provide. Learning is our secondary priority. Learning has a purpose. The purpose is some work, a project or some activity. Learning comes under a purpose.

<br />

Bigger problem is managing the life and managing the learning than the problem of learning itself. I researched life, economics, learning all are glued together. If you want to know how, I am publishing those papers one by one here in a different file. They are complex and entertaining also. But the point is, learning comes when you need or fail. Intentional learning is biologically associated with anxiety. Pscychology doesn't handle anxiety well. They consider it's a disease and most of the psychological disorders are anxiety disorders in deep.

<br />
 I want to make learning, working, managing, payments all integrated in this platform. So I tried to understand philosophy, economics as much as I could for this learning terms and learning system.

<br />
Another point to remember, I want people to learn those terms like the universe learns. As smooth as the universe. For initial phase, you need to read the Learning Terms md file.

<h3>Learning</h3>

The concept of learning is as big as the universe.

The universe learns as it changes.

Change happens randomly. But if you give some perspectives to those randomness, you can see some patterns. Those patterns are our prediction.

Those prediction we make to control stability. Let me explain.

Changes happen because of the interactions. Change happens to the objects and it's properties. (There are layers, levels, distance, motion, momentum, interaction, randomness, changes and many more. We are evolved to see and experience some of those properties.)

(There are more quantum properties vibration, frequency, wave, charge, energy, force, interactions, mass, existence, disappearance etc and many more.)

But the universe changes randomly as we know it. It doesn't have control over the changes. It doesn't have control over the outcome of the changes.
Intentional being like us predicts because it want to control the outcome of randomness. So that it knows what to keep stable.

What happens to them that change fast? They disappear fast. They change to other things. The go extinct.

What happens to them who change very slow? They stay. We call them stable things. We call them naturally selected. But natural selection isn't a selection process and the nature doesn't have an intention, we have.

We are intentional being. We want to control the outcome of changes. So we don't go extinct. So we predict. Predict everything before we do it. We only do it if the outcome is positive. We wouldn't do it if the outcome is negative for us. (That's why usually being scared of failiure is a natural thing).

For example, you will read this because there is text to read. You read this because there is something you find interesting. But if it was negative, you wouldn't do it. One step ahead, I call this Law of Happy Mode. If it's negative, it will break our law of happy mode. This brings us the Law of Anxiety.

Every step we take because we predicted the outcome would be positive. Learning is knowing the prediction before hand. Learning is knowing the patterns happening regularly and making it a stable by putting the patterns in our memory. So we can step ahead in complex and scary situations. But it's a game of changing anxiety towards happyness.

For example - as we play the game of anxiety - suffering, our perception learns that small failiure doesn't matter, we still survive. Only when we feel the failiures are fine.

The point is, we are a prediction machine.

Coming back to the universe. It doesn't have a intention. But our intention shapes our learning, so that we survive or become stable.

Changing in the universe sounds like learning. For intentional being, learning is building patterns so that we can predict. Remember there is a underlying reason of being stable (survival) causes us to learn.

Now let's see how our brain learns.

Our brain learns by creating neurological patterns.

Think of our brain. It creates neural connections and patterns based on what we perceive and experience. Those patterns are shaped based on our intentions.

So to our brain, learning is building neural connections. How it builds and shapes those connection depends on the experience and intention of a learner.

From my own research, I learned, brain's learning processing stays same, the intention becomes intelligent based on the social context of human. It's all about fitting among people. This brings up a lot of question, I will answer them as we move on.

That also means shaping learning is a skill for a brain. Not everyone can handle complex intensity of learning. Similar to skill development concept, learning skill has newbie, beginners, etc.

Learning Processing:- This gives us the concept of fraudian processing. I call this learning processing. Anything we do, is either already processed or needs to be processed. Processing means building the required neural connection based on the desire of a learner. Remember if the desire is huge, the processing is huge. If you want to build a Helicopter from sand, that's a huge processing your brain needs to do. But still just looking at the color of a book cover, can make you process billions of neurons. So giving it a time is absolutely necessary.

Learning Flow:- This processing creates Learning Flow. Anything we have intention becomes a flow through processing. Flow means a wave. Wave that has motion. We learn, do, move everything has a motion or flow. Each flow sounds like in a different frquency. Now this sounds weird. You will not get it until you personally realize it. Just for now, our brain does anything in a flow. That's why its hard to stop doing anything. It takes energy to stop a flow.

Depedency of Neural Connection:- You don't keep trying when you are processing. You will not make any progress, you will learn it until the processing is done. It's like there is no water, how can you drink. It's obvious, you need processed neuron in memory to say it's something I know, so I can tell. Not before. But we keep forcing ourselves.

Force learning:- Force learning can be defined in many ways. When a person tell their brain to learn when the brain's job is building neural connection or learning, the brain gets confused. It can't process the word learning as it dosen't know what to do extra. So, it keeps intensifying intentions. That's force learning.

When a person tries to force himself to learn when still the process is going on is force learning.

Learning Threads:- Every process is a thread. Our brain only can process a thread at a time. Giving the brain a few more thread only creates force learning.

Learning anxiety:- Learning anxiety is the result of force learning. I have a hypothesis that almost all disorders are developed from anxiety. Learning anxiety that creates PTSD stops us from learning.

Some of the biggest anxiety is figuring out Learning Path.

My biggest research has been in learning anxiety and I spend more than 7 years with around 30 people to figure out what are the biggest issues. But I am writing them in another file. All I want to call anxiety a trap. There are more traps

Anxiety Trap, Flow Trap, Intention Trap, Acknowledgement Trap, Unacknowledgement Trap, Hormonal Trap etc.

When a learning is processed, only then you can have an idea about it. This is your learning philosophy. Learning Philosophy is two types. Primary and secondary. Primary philosophies are the first ideas you got after the processing. Secondary philosophies are derived from primary philosophies.

There are two things a person learns when they learn anything. It's what they learn and how they learn. It's learning the thing, and learning the pattern of how to learn the thing.

Imagine you started learning naturally when you were a kid. For example, you learned to do gardenning with your parents. You learned how to take care of plants, flower, seeds and soil. That means you were exposed to learn naturally. It became your flow.

Now you are open to the world of school and the learning isn't natural anymore. You kept fighting all life to adjust to the new flow.

Amazing Learning is what I want to call the learning process that will be used in the system. I am naming it Learnea.

The purpose is to find the building blocks of philosophy, understanding and creating learning process, a learning framework as same as our brain as well as the nature.

To make a smooth learning experience, a learning system must follow all the properties of the learning terms.

For a intentional being, managing intentions and learnings is as big as life itself.

Learning system must approach like a great learning way of assumption, false analogy, use that analogy, improve it and move on. This validation and improvement never works. But it removes the anxiety from people who can’t think of a solution because it’s too out of touch. False analogy is a great way to learn. Now learning just for the sake of learning is boring and ptsd ed. So if you write a book and see analogies connecting and building helps the brain to understand how to do analogy of complex and unrecognizable patterns.

<h3>Base of learning system</h3>
<ul>
   <li><b>Layers and Level:- </b>Layers are like dymensions of the world. But in human context, layers are layers of logic or anything. When you understand a layer, you can explain everything under that layer from that perspective. You feel like leveled up
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Process and Threads:- </b>Learning happens in a process and each process is a thread. 
    </li>
    <li>
    <b>Flow:- </b> Two meaning of flow. One is we do everything in a flow. Another is if something isn't a flow, by our actions at some point it becomes a flow. The law of flow is, people can't see what flow they are in until they try to look at it
    </li>
    <li><b>Intentions:- </b> intentions are our desire to shape a learning towards something. Intentions turns into flow.</li>
    <li><b>Philosophy:- </b> flows turns into philosophy</li>
    <li><b>The learning cycle:- </b> Philosophies creates more intentions to more flow to more philosophies. At some point we level up and we can explain some layers of context in our mind. This is a learning cycle</li>
    <li><b>Learning break:- </b> we learn better when we take a break. This system will require your proof of extra and mindful acitivities to reward you points</li>
    <li><b>Acknowledgement theory:- </b> your brain starts processing when you acknowledge something.</li>
    <li><b>Acknowledgement theory:- </b> Your brain doesn't process when you don't acknowledge something</li>
    <li><b>Learning management:- </b>managing learning is much more important than learning. If management is messed up, you can't learn<>
    <li><b>Learning anxiety- </b> anxiety that comes up when you try to learn. This system makes you share and solve all the anxiety you got </li>

</ul>
